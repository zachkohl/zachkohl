        Military Service: Learning soft skills

        I wanted to serve my Country, so I entered ROTC at the University of
        Idaho where I would earn a commission as an Infantry Officer. The Army
        taught me a lot, things I still value in my career today. I learned
        public speaking, how to make friends with people you donâ€™t like, and the
        rigorous methods of military planning.

        At Fort Benning, the training really kicked into high gear. I got to do
        some fun stuff, like jump out of an airplane and practice staying up
        really late without dinner. It was at Fort Benning that I began to learn
        what real work ethic is. This is something I have taken with me as an
        engineer, occasionally you just have to grind out work. I also learned a
        to see working hard even when no one is looking as a big part of having
        integrity.
